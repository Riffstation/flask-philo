## Creating a new project
Flaskutils includes the `flaskutils-admin` command line tool.
To quickly generate a new flaskutils project, navigate to the directory in which you want to create the project and run:

```
flaskutils-admin startproject <project_name>
```

This will create a folder called project_name which will contain the basic structure of a flaskutils application.
